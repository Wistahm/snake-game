# Snake Game

Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game built using SDL2 in C, where the player controls a snake to eat 
food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with the snake's body and the screen borders. 
The game features smooth movement, randomized food spawning, and score tracking with a restart mechanism upon losing.
